If you get stuck on a particular question because you can't solve a programming problem, just write down in text *how* you would try to solve the problem - if correct this can give you partial points. Then continue the other parts of the question, the next question, or next task. The midterm is designed, such that the solutions do not require that the previous question is solved correctly. \n",

    "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of electrical brain stimulation. It send a weak electric current through the brain. tDCS is thought to increase brain plasticity if it is applied during behavioral training  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, our lab conducted a study looking at the causal effect of tDCS during motor sequence learning. Participant where a ad-hoc sample from the undergraduate population at UCL (University College London). Participants had to type out sequences of 5 numbers as fast as possible on a keyboard. First, they were tested before training (pre-test). We recorded both average movement time (MT), i.e. how many seconds they required to complete the 5 key presses, and the proportion of trials with an error (Error). To reduce the differences in preexisting performance, we decided to admit only participants that could do the task at pretest reasonably well (Movement time < 3.6s) to the main study. This led to the exclusion of 15 participants (not in the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Half of these participants were randomly assigned to a experimental group, and the other half to the control group. We decided to block for gender in this experiment, but no other variable. All participants trained the task for 4 consecutive days for 60min each with the left hand. During training, we attached two electrodes to their head. For the experimental group a current was sent between electrodes. The control group received only a brief stimulation, so they also experienced the initial tingle on the scalp, but after that the current was switched off. When interviewed afterwards, participants were not better at chance at guessing whether they were assigned to the tDCS or Control group.  \n",

    "The Data frame contains the following variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SN - Subject Number \n",
