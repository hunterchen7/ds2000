If you get stuck on a particular question because you can't solve a programming problem, just write down in text *how* you would try to solve the problem - if correct this can give you partial points. Then continue the other parts of the question, the next question, or next task. If you can only answer a question if you have solve the previous problem, just *assume* some outcome and answer the question under that assumption. If you do this, make your assumptions explicit. \n",

    "In 2007, Paulo Cortés and Aníbal Morais, at the University of Minho in Portugal, studied the use of data science techniques to tackle the challenging problem of forest fire prediction. They described their work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical andecological damage while endangering human lives. A good understanding of the risk factors and factor influencing the occurence of fires is therefore essential.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, forest fire risks are measured using the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FFWI) for rating forest fire danger. You are provided with a dataset from the Montesinho natural park, from the Tras-os-Montes northeast region of Portugal. The data used in the experiments was collected from January 2000 to December 2003. At a daily basis, every time a forest fire occurred, several features were collected such as the time, date, spatial location within a 9×9 grid and the type of vegetation involved, four components of the FWI system and the total burned area, and complemented with several weather observations (e.g. wind speed) recorded at the time of the event. The detailed variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9\n",
    "2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9\n",
    "3. month - month of the year: 'jan = 1 ' to 'dec = 12'\n",
    "4. day - day of the week: 'mon = 1' to 'sun = 7'\n",
    "5. FFMC - FFMC (Rain, Temperature, Wind and Humidity relationship) index from the FFWI system: 18.7 to 96.20\n",
    "6. DMC - DMC (Rain, Temperature,and Humidity relationship) index from the FFWI system: 1.1 to 291.3\n",
    "7. DC - DC (Rain and Temperature relationship) index from the FFWI system: 7.9 to 860.6\n",
    "8. ISI - ISI (Wind speed risk) index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10\n",
    "9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30\n",
    "10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100\n",
    "11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40\n",
    "12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4\n",
